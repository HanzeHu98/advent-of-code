# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems. I'm doing Advent of Code 2022, and adding solutions as I finish them.

Inside each year's directory, each day has a `dayXX.py` file that will run the code necessary to solve both stars for that day. Each file includes a header with a few comments on the problem.

All solutions are written in Python (for now, I may try to use other languages to solve some problems). You should be able to run each solution like this:

    $ python3 dayXX.py
